const analysis = "Determining what software is required to be built and the user expectations."
const design = "Developers define the technical details of the product."
const implementation = "This allows the developer to explain and show the user how the product is run, including training and installation."
const testingAndIntegration = "Developers allow the testing team to run and test the software that has been built. The testing team determines wether the product meets the customers needs."
